Objectives

    1) Use previously generated "raw" Illumina paired-end reads (FASTQs) as input files to analyze

    2) Execute some file exploration of the FASTQ files

    4) Create a table with information for each of the 4 FASTQ files

    3) Write a python script to:
        -Distribute phred score based on position in the read and generate a histogram
        -Do this for all four files (2 index, 2 reads)




Initial file exploration

    The two read files are R1 and R4. The two index files are R3 and R4.

    Read length:

        The following bash command was used for each of the 4 files:

            \$ zcat <name>.fq | grep -v "^@" | grep -v "^+" | awk '{print length $0}' | head 

            outputs:
                1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz = 101
                1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz = 8
                1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz = 8
                1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz = 101

    Phred encoding:

        This is an Illumina sequence. The phred score is phred + 33.
